Local patches are intentionally small and browser-focused:

- Emscripten-safe file mapping in `src/common/fs.*`
- Emscripten-safe file copying for injected dylibs crossing browser filesystem backends
- Mach-O size guard before reading the mapped magic value
- Browser unsupported stubs for raw-socket OCSP and `system()`
- Emscripten exclusion for the macOS-only `csreq` diagnostic `popen`
- `optind` reset before `main()` so repeated WASM invocations are deterministic
